                <p>My name is Scotty Yackzan, and I am a passionate Full Stack Web and Game Developer. 
                    Despite discovering my enthusiasm for programming later in life, my dedication is 
                    unwavering. The past several years have been a continuous programming journey, during which 
                    I've acquired a comprehensive understanding of Software Development. Whether you're seeking assistance 
                    in launching a full-scale website or building and designing a new game, I am here to provide my expertise. 
                    While I possess multiple strengths, I acknowledge that the programming landscape is dynamic and rapidly 
                    evolving. Please refer to my highlighted strengths below and my portfolio below to if I am the right fit for your 
                    next project.
